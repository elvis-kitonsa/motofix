# motofix-core — Core Gateway

A small central service that the other MOTOFIX services and the admin dashboard talk to.
It holds **no business logic** of its own — think of it as the platform's switchboard /
notice board. It does three jobs:

1. **Service registry** — keeps the master list of where every other service lives.
2. **Health aggregation** — pings each service's `/health` and reports who is up/degraded/down.
3. **Shared config** — hands out platform-wide settings (subscription price, bank details,
   feature flags).

## Endpoints

| Method | Path          | Auth     | Description |

| GET    | `/health`     | none     | Liveness check for the gateway itself. |
| GET    | `/services`   | none     | The service registry (names → base URLs). |
| GET    | `/health/all` | none     | Probes every registered service concurrently and returns an overall verdict (`healthy` / `degraded` / `critical`). Used by the admin status panel. |
| GET    | `/config`     | Bearer JWT | Platform-wide config: service URLs, feature flags, subscription pricing, payment/bank details. |
