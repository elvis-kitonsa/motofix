# schemas.py
# Defines the SHAPE of the data this service sends and receives over the API.
# Each class is one "form": it lists the fields allowed, their types, and whether
# they're required. FastAPI uses these to automatically check incoming requests
# and to document the API. Read these first to understand what the service expects.
#
#   MatchRequest      — what the caller sends in (where + what kind of help is needed)
#   MechanicCandidate — one scored mechanic in the reply
#   MatchResponse     — the full reply: the ranked list of candidates
#   DispatchOutcome   — report back whether a mechanic accepted/declined/expired
