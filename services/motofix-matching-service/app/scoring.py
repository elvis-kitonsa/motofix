"""
Intelligent mechanic-matching scorer.

Weights mirror the production XGBoost-Monotonic matching model's learned feature
importances (Top-1 accuracy 73%): expertise and availability dominate, with arrival
speed deliberately secondary — so a complex breakdown isn't sent to a closer
generalist. The monotonic property is preserved here by the linear proximity term:
match priority falls as distance rises, unless offset by stronger skill/rating.

  spec_match    35.46%  — right skill for the fault (primary filter)
  availability  29.78%  — available & reliable enough to take + finish the job
  proximity     10.20%  — arrival speed (secondary to expertise)
  rating         2.67%  — historical star quality
