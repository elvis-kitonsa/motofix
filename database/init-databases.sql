-- Runs automatically on first Postgres container boot (docker-entrypoint-initdb.d).
-- Creates all MOTOFIX service databases if they do not already exist.
-- Each service owns its own database; schemas are managed by the service itself on startup.
-- Is just the setup script for the databases; tables and schemas are created by the services on startup.
-- The real database engine and data are in the Docker volume "motofix-postgres-data", which is mounted to /var/lib/postgresql/data in the container.
